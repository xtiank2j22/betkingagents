<p> </p>
<p><span>90 minutes play</span></p>
<p><span>Delayed, moved or suspended matches</span></p>
<p><span>Matches not played as listed</span></p>
<p><span> Settlement of matches, statistics and other data </span></p>
<p><span>Betting markets rules (Betting Types) </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>90 minutes play</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Unless otherwise stated, all bets on football (soccer) markets apply to 90 minutes of play according to the match officials, plus any added injury or stoppage time. However extra time and penalty shoot-outs are not included. The only exceptions from this rule: matches that are scheduled for a different duration (e.g. 60, 70, 80 or 120 minutes) as agreed by the laws of the competition in which they are competing or agreed by both sides prior to kick-off ( i.e. Youth matches, where games last for 80 minutes). In such cases, if the match is played in the traditional format of two halves, all bets will be settled at the end of the agreed game length which includes time added on by the referee for stoppages (whether the game length is advertised by BetKing or not). </span></p>
<p><span>FIFA rules in respect to the duration of friendly youth matches:</span></p>
<p><span>for U18, U17, U16, U15 teams – 80 minutes (two halves of 40 minutes each);</span></p>
<p><span>U14 teams – 70 minutes (two halves of 35 minutes each), all 70 minutes of play must elapse for bets to stand; </span></p>
<p><span>U13 and U12 teams – 60 minutes (two halves of 30 minutes each), all 60 minutes of play must elapse for bets to stand.</span></p>
<p><span>The rules of friendlies are determined before the start of a tournament. The Customer should check the rules from independent sources of information prior to placing bets on friendlies.</span></p>
<p><span>If the match is played in an unusual format (e.g. 3 or 4 periods,90 minutes or less) then all half-time markets will be voided but all other markets will be settled on the basis of the score at the end of the match (including any time added on by the referee for stoppages).All placed bets will be voided if the match is officially declared as a 'no classify'. (4 x 30 minutes and all other variations apart from stated rules).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Delayed, moved or suspended matches</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If an event or game as a single bet is cancelled, the bet will be considered with odd 1.00 and the stake will be returned to the player. If an event or game in a double or multiple bet is cancelled, the cancelled bet will be considered with odd 1.00 and all other bets odds remain normal. In any case of an obvious mistake or error identified by us, we reserve the right to cancel the bet in whole or in part or to rectify the mistake if applicable.</span></p>
<p><span>In cases where over 90% of the scheduled match time has been completed and the referee ends the match before the assigned time has elapsed then we will use that result for the settlement of all bets placed on the game. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Unless otherwise stated for certain Sports/bet typologies, whenever an event is officially postponed or abandoned, all bets related to that event will remain valid if the event takes place and is completed within midnight (WAT) of the day following the date originally set for the match.</span></p>
<p><span>If it does not take place or is not completed within the mentioned time frame, all bets related to that event will be voided within 24 hours, except the bets which were placed on markets that have been unconditionally determined, which will stand.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>If a mach is restarted from the beginning, all bets placed before the market went in-play will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be voided, except when the bets were placed in-play on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which will stand. </span></p>
<p><span>Examples of unconditionally determined markets: </span></p>
<p><span>If you place a bet on Total goals in the first half being 2 or more and the match gets interrupted in the 40th minute at 1-1 result, the bet is won.</span></p>
<p><span>If you place a bet on 1/1 type for HT / FT market and the match is interrupted in the 60th minute with a 0-1 halftime score, then the bet is lost.</span></p>
<p><span>If you place a bet on 1/1 type for HT / FT market, and the match is interrupted in the 40th minute at 1-1 score, we are facing a situation where the bet will be void if the match is not played by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span></span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Matches not played as listed</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In case that any team starts the match with less than 11 players, all bets on that match will be made void.</span></p>
<p><span>Football (Soccer) kickoff dates and times displayed on BetKing website are an indication only and are not guaranteed to be correct. If an official fixture lists different team details to those listed on the BetKing website (e.g. official fixture specifies in the team name, Reserves/Age Group e.g. Under 21's/Gender e.g. Women, etc.), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be void. In all other cases, bets will stand (e.g. any wager on whether a team advances in a cup competition, or raises the cup, will have action regardless of a suspended or postponed match). </span></p>
<p><span>If the home team and away team for a listed match are reversed (e.g. match is played at the away team's ground) then bets placed on the affected markets will be void. For matches played at neutral venues, the team listed on the left are still classed as the 'home' team for settlement purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>A club team playing a European competition is classed as playing at home if the fixture is moved from the team's usual ground to another ground within their national boundaries, e.g. when Arsenal played their Champions League home ties at Wembley.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Settlement of matches, statistics and other data</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Void - means cancelled events or bets as a result of abandoned matches, postponed matches, played before scheduled, technical result (awarded,walkover), obvious errors, etc. Void bets are calculated with odds of 1.00.</span></p>
<p><span>Bets on football matches labelled “extra time” will be settled excluding penalty shootouts. Bets on penalty shootouts are accepted separately.</span></p>
<p><span>All bets are settled on the final score displayed at the end of the match. If a result is changed or declared void for any reason by sports’ governing body at any time following the end of the match, such change will not alter the result for betting customers and the original result will dictate any bets and/or winnings already paid.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of ambiguity over the official result from match officials, the outcome will be determined by BetKing (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources.</span></p>
<p><span>If a team is disqualified, thrown out or otherwise removed from a league before the relevant season has started then all bets involving that team will be made void.</span></p>

<td style="width: 404px;">
<p><strong>Predict the outcome of a match after the indicated handicap score has been applied to the 2nd half result of the match. For example: handicap score (0:2) indicates that the Away team was given two goals advantage, handicap score (1,5:0) indicates that home team was given 1,5 goals advantage, etc. Asian handicap is a two-way handicap, meaning that there are only 2 possible outcomes - win of the Home team (1H) or win of the Away team (2H). In case of a whole goal handicap (values in brackets would be whole numbers), if the result is a draw after the handicap has been taken into consideration, then all bets will be voided and stake will be refunded.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By placing a bet on the value in brackets that represents a quarter of one or more goals (value in brackets ends with '',25'' or '',75''), the bet can be half-won (half of the stake multiplied by the odds is won, the other half of the stake will be refunded) or half-lost (half of the stake will be refunded). For quarter goal handicaps, half the stake is settled a quarter goal below the handicap, and half the stake settled a quarter goal above the handicap.</strong></p>
